# Simone Game

Project created on Christmas holidays :christmas_tree: during my web development training at Wild Code School :school_satchel: 

You can see it deployed [here](https://simone-game.herokuapp.com/)

### Goal

I wanted to code something by myself, using as much React hooks as possible :gear: :gear: :hook:  

I was motivated by the algorithm challenge and the retro look of Simon game !
