# Welcome to Simone Game's repo !

This solo project has been created on Christmas holidays :christmas_tree: during my web development training at Wild Code School :school_satchel: 

### Goal

I wanted to code something by myself, using as much React hooks as possible :gear: :gear: :gear:  

I was motivated by the algorithm challenge and the retro look of Simon game !
ðŸ’» This project uses Javascript, React and CSS3.
